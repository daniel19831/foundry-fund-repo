Recommended Tools
Recommended Testnet: Sepolia
Recommended DevOps: foundry-devops
Testnet Faucets
Main Faucet: https://faucets.chain.link
Backup Faucet: https://sepoliafaucet.com/
⚠️ All code associated with this course is for demo purposes only. They have not been audited and should not be considered production ready. Please use at your own risk.

Resources For This Course
AI Frens
ChatGPT
Just know that it will often get things wrong, but it's very fast!
Phind
Like ChatGPT, but it searches the web
Bard
Other AI extensions
Github Discussions
Ask questions and chat about the course here!
Stack Exchange Ethereum
Great place for asking technical questions about Ethereum
Peeranha
Decentralized Stack Exchange!
Bonus NFTs
These are 100% optional to do.

Sepolia
Arbitrum
After every lesson, you'll see two QR codes. Those codes will send you to an NFT deployed to Sepolia or Arbitrum. They contain a challenge for you to solve, and in return, you'll be given an AWESOME NFT.

Important Notes for Arbitrum
IF YOU DECIDE TO MINT THE REAL NFT:

We didn't audit the NFT, so if you want to make sure you'll be safe, interact with the contract using a burner wallet (a wallet with very little money that you don't use for anything else)
In fact... Get good at interacting with wallets from a burner wallet
Read my Tweet thread on basic wallet safety
It might be a good idea to wait till later in the course when we teach you about verifying metamask transactions.
Feel free to mint NFTs on sepolia without worrying about the above
Bridging to Arbitrum
We didn't show you how to bring ETH -> Arbitrum, but the process would be:
Buy ETH (On an exchange like Coinbase or Kraken)
Send ETH -> one of your wallets like:
Metamask
Frame
Rainbow
Argent
Coinbase Wallet
Use the Arbitrum Bridge

Best Practices
Follow the repository: While going through the course be 100% certain to follow along with the github repository. If you run into in an issue check the chronological-updates in the repo.
Be Active in the community: Ask questions and engage with other developers going through the course in the discussions tab, be sure to go and say hello or gm! This space is different from the other industries, you don't have to be secretive; communicate, network and learn with others :)
Learn at your own pace: It doesn't matter if it takes you a day, a week, a month or even a year. Progress >>> Perfection
Take Breaks: You will exhaust your mind and recall less if you go all out and watch the entire course in one sitting. Suggested Strategy every 25 minutes take a 5 min break, and every 2 hours take a longer 30 min break
Refer to Documentation: Things are constantly being updated, so whenever Patrick opens up some documentation, open it your end and maybe even have the code sample next to you.
Use ChatGPT and/or the course chat

Summary:
When you look to deploy 
with real money, you should use either:
1. A password encrypted keystore
2. Something like thirdweb deploy

The idea is you never want to have 
your private key or password 
ANYWHERE written in plain text

Disclosures
Transparency is important! So we want to disclose any potential conflicts that might have affected my judgement so you can pick tools that are right for you. Patrick is co-founder of Alpha Chain, a blockchain infrastructure company. Alpha Chain runs Chainlink, Ethereum, Binance, Polygon, Harmony, Solana, Moonbeam, and Moonriver blockchain services. Alpha Chain often works with Alchemy and receives discounted services. Patrick is the co-founder of Cyfrin, and they do smart contract security & auditing services. Patrick is also the co-founder of Chain Accel, who is an advisor on the Peeranha project. Patrick is an advisor on the Chainlink project. The Cyfrin team often does buisness on the Arbitrum L2.

Because of all this, I have added alternatives to each section where we suggest a tool. This video & course was created and sponsored solely by the Cyfrin team.
